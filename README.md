# Soundboard
## Usage:
This app scans the internal storage of your Android device for sound files (.mp3 or .wav).

The sound files must be structured by folders representing groups of sound.

The groups are displayed as tabs and the sounds as elements of a list view.

You can also favor single sounds.

## Example:
This sounds are in one group:
```
/sdcard/Soundboard/MLG/Airhorn.mp3
/sdcard/Soundboard/MLG/Wow.wav
```

And this sound is in another:
```
/sdcard/Soundboard/Misc/Laughing.wav
```
